Hi, I’m @lucafesta a mathematic.
I’m interested in Python, Tensorflow and C++. I have competence in machine learning algorithm with regression, computer vision and scheduling problems.
I’m currently learning machine learning in real time with robots application.
I’m looking to collaborate on some project that create interaction between computer vision and real time programming.
Fell free to send me some e-mail to festa.luca996@gmail.com
